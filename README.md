# my-website
Practice with html. Building a website with my favorite things - bikes, recipes, coding projects, etc.
I started this project before pushing it to GitHub so my initial commit contains the home page, a page called bikes with a few images and text, a page with my coding projects currently only containing a link to the homepage of this site, and a recipe page that is currently empty
